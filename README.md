IntelliJ includes Maven and installing Java would be easier, but you can install it if you want. Maven can be downloaded

Before getting on with it, It is important to mention that the API which will be used to practice Karate is provided
by [Bondar academy](https://www.bondaracademy.com/), and it will only be used for educational purposes. You can see the
